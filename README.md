This is an ongoing open-sourced project which focuses on creating web-based tools for computational design. Our studio is dedicated to building custom parametric models for the web - this our repository for sharing utility functions with example files.

### Examples
Example files are in the <a href="https://github.com/modelab/mode.js/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">examples</a> directory for this repo.  Additional demos are posted periodically on <a href="http://executable.io/" target="_blank">http://executable.io/</a>.

### Documentation
In-progress documentation is currently stored <a href="http://executable.io/html/mode-js/doc/MODE.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Dependencies
Many of the utility functions are dependent on some of our favorite libraries:
##### <a href="http://threejs.org/" target="_blank">THREE.js</a> - we use this for 3D and GPU operations
Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js uses WebGL. The source code is hosted in a repository on GitHub.
##### <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> - We use this for 2D vector graphics and data management/visualization
D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.
